# OUT WITH THE OLD?
# Virtual Reality Curriculum
## *Can 3D virtual reality labratories replace traditional labratory learning?*

### Purpose
- The students will use virtual reality hardware to gain real-world virtual hands-on experiences that can be delivered remotely or in the traditional classroom environment. 
### Abstract
- The goal of this project is to develop new Cyber-Human Systems that integrate new learning modules in the field of information technology which will incorporate hands-on learning activities into the curriculum that are generated using virtual reality technologies.  The students would wear a virtual reality headset to virtually complete hands-on laboratory assignments.  The delivery of the content is only limited by the access to the technology which can be purchased for as little as five dollars.  This project’s primary deliverables are virtual reality classroom learning materials which will enhance science and engineering skills for diverse or remote populations of students.  To achieve this goal, the following objectives have been identified; 
### Research Team
- The use of stereoscopic 3D multimedia content creation techniques mixed with the video game creation process were utilized by the research team  to create the virtual reality computer engineering laboratory learning environments.  Please ask to use our demonstration technology!
### Varibles & Research
- Experimental Grouping:  Online students with virtual instruction.
- Traditional Grouping:  In person students with traditionally delivered hands-on laboratories.
The software created and showcased via this research experience will be used to do extended testing this and next semester.
### Materials
- Gaming Engine:  Unity
- Team of 5 members: Programmers, Graphic Designers, User Acceptance Testers.
- Computer Hardware including PC and Macintoshes
- Mobile Phones for testing software
### Virtual Reality Creation Process
- **Research Objective 1:** Define subject matter and laboratory assignments that are best suited to the medium of virtual Stereoscopic 3D environments by communicating with industry experts on virtual reality content production and delivery. 
- **Research Objective 2:** Develop computer engineering lessons that could be disseminated in virtual reality laboratory settings that require human computer interactions, instead of passive viewing experiences, to complete the learning experiences.  
- **Research Objective 3:** Directly compare student performance with virtual reality curriculum against traditional in-person hands-on curricular experiences.  The results will be supported by research with a student population in order to determine the efficacy of virtual reality classroom experiences in direct comparison to traditional hands-on laboratory experiences. 
- **Research Objective 4:**  After preliminary quantitative and qualitative research results, determine which target student populations would be best identified for the distribution of virtual reality classroom scenarios.  As the curriculum can be distributed completely separately from the traditional classroom environment, remote applications for individuals with disabilities, or people in rural areas or of low socioeconomic status could be provided with experiences that would otherwise not be obtainable without the aid of completely virtual classroom environments. 
### Virtual Reality:  Multimedia Learning Advantages and Disadvantages.
- **Pros**
  - Increased interest to learn and review materials in virtual reality.
  - Easier to visualize objects shape and size.
  - Students can potentially learn hands-on learning objectives at home, or via online distance education.
- **Cons**
  - Requires special viewing equipment such as the Google Cardboard.
  - Not everyone can view Stereoscopic 3D materials.
  - Can cause dizziness with prolonged viewing.
### Conclusion
- The results of this research will provide a comprehensive understanding of effectiveness of replacing traditional classroom environments with digital classrooms powered by advancements in virtual reality and S3D multimedia.  These results will provide the education community with insight into the nature of implementing new and innovative educational technology to promote learning in a variety of environments with diverse student populations using Virtual Reality classroom environment.
